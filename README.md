**Delhi Air Quality Insights (2020–2023)**

A Data-Driven Analysis of Urban Air Pollution in India’s Capital

**Introduction**

**Delhi Air Pollution Crisis**

Delhi consistently ranks among the most polluted cities in the world. Rapid urbanization, vehicular emissions, construction activity, industrial pollution, biomass burning, and adverse meteorological conditions contribute to severe deterioration in air quality—especially during winter months.

This project presents a comprehensive data analytics study of Delhi’s air quality between 2020 and 2023, using hourly pollutant-level data to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, pollutant dominance, and the frequency of clean air days.

The objective is not just visualization, but actionable insight generation for public health awareness and policy-level understanding.

**About the Project**

**Domain:** Pollution Data Analytics

**Location:** Delhi, India

**Time Period:** 2020 – 2023

**Data Granularity:** Hourly observations

**Project Type:** End-to-End Data Analytics Case Study

**Problem Statement**

Air pollution in Delhi poses a serious threat to public health and environmental sustainability. Despite multiple policy interventions, pollution levels remain persistently high.

**This project aims to address the following questions:**

•What are the dominant pollutants affecting Delhi’s air quality?

•How does air pollution vary seasonally and monthly?

•How frequently does Delhi experience clean air?

•Which AQI categories dominate over time?

•Is air pollution episodic or structurally recurring?

**Objectives**

•Clean and preprocess large-scale hourly air quality data

•Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

•Identify seasonal and temporal pollution trends

•Analyze pollutant-wise contribution to air quality

•Classify air quality using standard AQI categories

•Build an interactive dashboard for insight delivery

**Summary of Results**

**1. Particulate Matter Dominance**

•PM10 and PM2.5 are the primary drivers of Delhi’s poor air quality.

•Average PM2.5 values remain far above safe limits.

**2. Seasonal Pollution Pattern**

•Severe pollution spikes occur every winter.

•Pollution levels drop during monsoon months but remain unhealthy.

**3. AQI Category Distribution**

•Over 60% of recorded hours fall under Poor to Severe AQI.

•Clean air conditions are extremely rare.

**4. Clean Air Days**

•Only 31 clean days recorded across four years.

•Indicates chronic exposure rather than episodic pollution.
